# How Play ? :hammer:

Letâ€™s name JosÃ© the poor man that will be hanging to this rope if you lose.

The aim is to find the word that the computer chose. The player can suggest either a word or a letter among the 26 letters of the alphabets to find the word. You can't use 2 times the same letters and you will have 10 attempts to complete the game. When the player suggest a word, if the word is found the game stops, if not, the counter of attempts decrease by 2.
The program continues until the word is either found, or the numbers of attempts is 0. 

If you want to stop the game the player has to write "STOP" in the input. It will save the game. If the player want to continue the game, write this command :
```bash
  go run main/main.go --startWith save.txt
```
That allow you to launch the game with the file you saved before.
